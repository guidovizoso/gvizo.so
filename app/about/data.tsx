    Leading multiple frontend teams with my main focus building a factoring platform product. The stack is Typescript, NextJs, React, react-query, TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui. In this role I have to evaluate code reviews, mentor fellow developers and define the best practices and standards for the projects. I'm also contributing to the roadmap of the products by asessing new features, talking to product team and stakeholders and providing feedback and suggestions on how to improve the user experience.

    Worked alongside a small team building a creative graphics design tool on the web as well its social and community features. The stack was NextJs + React, Typescript, Express, Prisma and PostgreSQL. Since we were just a few we all worked on everything, from UI to backend. Being so niche of a product it has presented its own set of challenges that made working on Kittl really unique.

    Joined a team tasked with building a brand new platform. Main tech stack was React and Redux but it was my responsibility to choose build tools and libraries for the platform. It was also my first time officially mentoring junior frontend developers and it was highly successful. I’m still in touch and providing advice to some of them.
